  "description": "Gazebo is an open-source 3D robot simulator known for its robust physics engine and tight ROS integration, ideal for validating robotic algorithms. Unity, a powerful game engine, offers advanced rendering and a growing robotics ecosystem for high-fidelity sensor simulation and AI training. This section explores the practical setup and utilization of both Gazebo and Unity for designing, testing, and refining robotic systems in virtual environments.",
