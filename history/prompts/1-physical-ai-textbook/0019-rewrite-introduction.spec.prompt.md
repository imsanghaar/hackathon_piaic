# User Request

Go to this: https://ai-native.panaversity.org/docs/Introducing-AI-Driven-Development

and create introduction just like but for my book, same context "The Rise Of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics"

# Response

Completely rewrote the introduction (`docs/introduction/index.md`) following the structure and compelling narrative style of the reference, but entirely focused on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics.

**Structure mirrored from reference:**
1. **Opening hook**: Real-world examples (Boston Dynamics Atlas, Figure 02, Tesla Optimus, Agility Digit) showing the transformation happening now
2. **What Makes This Moment Different**: Three converging forces (AI embodiment threshold, photorealistic simulation, economic shift)
3. **What You'll Learn**: Overview of all 4 modules with key insights for each
4. **What You Won't Learn (Yet)**: Clear scope definition (software/AI focus, not mechanical engineering)
5. **A Note on Mindset**: Perspective shift from traditional robotics to AI-driven learning paradigms
6. **The Three Laws of Physical AI**: Core principles for success
7. **Why This Book Exists**: The democratization story
8. **By the End of This Book**: Specific, measurable outcomes with checkboxes
9. **Stay Curious**: Call to action for different reader personas

**Key adaptations for Physical AI:**
- Referenced actual 2024-2025 robotics breakthroughs (Atlas, Figure 02, Optimus Gen 2, Digit)
- Used robotics industry data ($91B by 2030, 5M robots deployed)
- Emphasized VLA models, simulation, and embodied intelligence
- Focused on ROS 2, Isaac Sim, Gazebo as the core toolset
- Highlighted the sim-to-real paradigm shift
- Made it accessible to beginners while showing the opportunity for all levels

The introduction now has the same energy, structure, and persuasive power as the reference while being 100% authentic to the Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics domain.
