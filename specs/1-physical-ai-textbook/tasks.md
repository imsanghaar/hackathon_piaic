# Tasks: AI/Spec-Driven Book Creation

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/1-physical-ai-textbook/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel
- **[Story]**: User story ID (US1 relates to core content, US2 relates to homepage)

## Phase 1: Setup (Docusaurus Project Initialization)

**Purpose**: Ensure the Docusaurus project is initialized and ready for content.

- [x] T001 Verify `npm install` completes successfully in the project root. (Reference: `quickstart.md`)
- [x] T002 Confirm `npm run start` successfully launches the local development server. (Reference: `quickstart.md`)

## Phase 2: Book Content Generation (US1)

**Goal**: Completely replace existing book content with new material from the source markdown, structured for Docusaurus.

- [x] T003 Remove all existing content from the `docs/` directory.
- [x] T004 Recreate the `docs/` directory structure for modules and chapters (e.g., `introduction`, `ros-2-fundamentals`) based on the planned structure.
- [x] T005 [P] Create `_category_.json` files for each new module to define sidebar labels and order.
- [x] T006 Populate the new `docs/` directories with content extracted and adapted from `Hackathon_ Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook.md`.
- [x] T007 Update `sidebars.ts` if necessary (verify default autogenerated behavior).

## Phase 3: Homepage Branding and Layout (US2)

**Goal**: Customize the homepage with the new book title, hero image, branding, and overall layout.

- [x] T008 Update `docusaurus.config.ts` to set the main `title` to "The Rise Of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics" and update `navbar.title`.
- [x] T009 Ensure `static/img/book-cover-page.png` is present in the `static/img/` directory. If not, move/copy it there.
- [x] T010 Modify `src/components/Hero/index.tsx` to use `static/img/book-cover-page.png` as the hero image.
- [x] T011 Modify `src/components/Hero/index.tsx` to change "Sanghaar AI-Native Book Series" to "Imam Sanghaar AI Book Series" and add a visual border.
- [x] T012 Update the "Start Reading" button on the homepage to link to the book's introduction page (`/docs/introduction/`).
- [x] T013 Redesign the overall homepage layout in `src/pages/index.tsx` to align with the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" theme, using new or modified components.

## Phase 4: Content Expansion (FR-009)

**Goal**: Expand the content of each chapter with brief, comprehensive explanations.

- [x] T014 Expand the content of `docs/introduction/index.md` with detailed explanations.
- [x] T015 Expand the content of `docs/ros-2-fundamentals/*.md` files with detailed explanations.
- [x] T016 Expand the content of `docs/digital-twin/*.md` files with detailed explanations.
- [x] T017 Expand the content of `docs/nvidia-isaac-platform/*.md` files with detailed explanations.
- [x] T018 Expand the content of `docs/vla-and-conversational-robotics/*.md` files with detailed explanations.
- [x] T019 Add a new chapter for "Hardware Requirements" as a top-level section, expanding content.

## Phase N: Verification and Polish

**Purpose**: Final checks to ensure the site is functional and aesthetically pleasing.

- [x] T020 Run `npm run build` to ensure the static site builds without errors and check for any new broken links.
- [x] T021 Run `npm run start` to visually verify all homepage changes, content, and navigation locally. (Note: This is an interactive step for the user)
- [x] T022 Deploy the site to GitHub Pages. (Interactive step for user)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: Must be completed first.
- **Phase 2 (Book Content Generation)**: Depends on Phase 1.
- **Phase 3 (Homepage Branding and Layout)**: Depends on Phase 2 (as content structure affects navigation).
- **Phase 4 (Content Expansion)**: Depends on Phase 2. Can be done in parallel with or after Phase 3.
- **Phase N (Verification and Polish)**: Depends on all prior content and layout changes being complete.
